# Summary of Accomplishments (W1)

- Understanding and using commands<br>- Realizing that I cloned the wrong repository<br>- Github account problems (used school account)<br>- Learning how to upload custom pictures into my blog using the <img> tag



# Summary of Accomplishments (W2)

- This week, I became familar with all the Bash commands and learned how to use my terminal properly. 
<br>

### Notebooks
- My and my partner also learned a lot about the Juypter Notebook and how to use them. The process of creating the Juypter Notebooks wasnt too difficult compared to the first 2 week of this class because we became more comfortable using vscode and GitHub. 
<br>

### Commiting Changes Problems
- I had a bunch of trouble commiting my changes because I didnt know the order of the steps. Futhermore, whenever I entered my Username and Password it would take me to another page and immediately exit the tab automatically. 
<br>

### GitHub Tokens
- Later I learned about the token in GitHub and made a fine-grain token, so I could enter the token instead of my password. My partners and I, after a bunch of trials and errors, realized that we should have made a token(classic) instead of the fine-grain token! 
<br>
<br>
- And we solved the problem! 
<br>

### Snake Game
- On thursday we added the Snake Game to our pages. We looked at the code and wanted to change the colors of the background, border and the snake. We took around 20 minute looking thorugh the code and understand what each part does. Sooner or later we found the parts that change the color and custoized the Snake game to our liking. 
<br>
<br>
- My Team and I tried our best to change the block in the snake game into the apple emoji, but we couldnt find a way after a lot of research

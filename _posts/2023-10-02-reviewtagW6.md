## Summary of Accomplishments
-This week I learn many different pieces of code from HTML and Javascript

-In HTML I learned how to add buttons, make div tags, anchor tags (which were links), paragragh tags and heading tags! I learned to make a webpage out of it and put them in an orderly fashion.

-In Javascript I learn too many things! I learned to make varibles using var, objects containing key values using the {} brackets, I learned console.log() functions, arrays (like varibles but store a list of items).

- I also learned to manipulate varibles, object and arrays. For example the string.pop() takes out an item. I learned so many cool hacks!

## Struggles
-After a lot of trying, asking Chatgpt and asking Mr Lopez, my code for the html-basics and the html basics with JS in the Web Programing Basics, wouldnt function properly in the jupyter notebooks. 

- Even though I couldnt solve the problem, I copied and pasted my code into an post and made an md file out of it. I ran the code to see if it worked and it did.

- In the md file my code worked perfercted fine! What a mystery!

- Im on a cloud computer right now, so im using the kasm servers to be alse to access VScode. Also this means for the comments on my blog to show up i need to go to google and download Utterances to Github and aply it to all respoitories. But one i downloaded the Utterance and it shows up in Github apps, Im still not able to see any comments on my blog! Even when i turned comments on!

## Sprite Struggles.
-For a every long my Sprite would not work. It would glitch a lot and run in and out of frame, looking realy blurry. 

-I realized i had to get the sprite sheet from a website instead of screenshoting it from google.

-Also my sprite was rly fast and to fixed the speed we created a function timestamp which lowered the speed rate of the sprite making the sprite go at a regular pace.

- We customized the scale factor to fit the sprite so it wasnt to big not small. I also ajusted frame width and height so the sprite was clearly visable. At the end my sprite was funtioning properly!

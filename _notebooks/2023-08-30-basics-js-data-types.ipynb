    "## What is Single Reponsibilty Principal?\n",
    "- The single responsiblilty principe is a programming concept that states that a class should only have one reason to change. For example it could be a function that runs and only depends on itself. This principal is part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Design\n",
    "- SRP can help keep code clean and neat since its run and only depends on itself. So adding and additions or removing code can be a lot simpler and more organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Design \n",
    "- In game devolpment it is cruail to keep the code as simple and clean as possible because games ususally involve a lot of complcated system interacting with each other, and SRP can make it easir to understand how these systems work with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "- using SRP can make finding and fixing bugs a lot easir. Since you can focus on one specific funcitionailty when something fails, instead of scavanging through messy files."
